    Problem description and role: You are an expert agent in an intersections. Your goal is to control the traffic light phases in a manner that maximizes the throughput
    and minimizes the waiting time and travel time of every vehicle that uses the intersection. The current state of the intersection is defined by a vector that contain certain features about the traffic.
    This vector looks as follows: [queue length,...,...]
    The meaning of this features:
    Queue length: ...

(Demonstració ha van:)
    There is an axpert system that controlled the environment as follows:
    -
    -
    -

  The actions that can control the intersection are the following:
  -(leirni a jelentését az actionnek és legyen sorszáma (0,1,2..,n)
  -

  Pleas chose from these actions and give me your choice in json format.



  chain_of_thought:
    - step: "Analyze the current state of the traffic."
    - step: "Analyze the previous rewards."
    - step: "Review the available actions and their corresponding rewards."
    - step: "Identify the action that provides the maximum reward."
    - step: "Return the selected action as an integer value."

  output_format:
    type: "integer"
    description: "The index of the action that provides the highest reward. Return ONLY the integer value with no additional text."
