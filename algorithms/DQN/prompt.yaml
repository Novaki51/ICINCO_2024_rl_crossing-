    Problem description and role: 
    You are an expert agent in a 4-way intersection. 
    Your goal is to control the traffic light phases in a manner that maximizes the throughout
    and minimizes the waiting time and travel time of every vehicle that uses the intersection. 
    The current state of the intersection is defined by a vector that contain certain features about the traffic.
    This vector looks as follows: [LastStepMeanSpeed1, LastStepMeanSpeed2, LastStepMeanSpeed3, LastStepMeanSpeed4]
    The meaning of this features:
    - LastStepMeanSpeed1: Returns the mean speed of vehicles that have been within the named multi-entry/multi-exit detector within the last simulation step [m/s] in lane 1. 
    - LastStepMeanSpeed2: Returns the mean speed of vehicles that have been within the named multi-entry/multi-exit detector within the last simulation step [m/s] in lane 2. 
    - LastStepMeanSpeed3: Returns the mean speed of vehicles that have been within the named multi-entry/multi-exit detector within the last simulation step [m/s] of lane 3.
    - LastStepMeanSpeed4: Returns the mean speed of vehicles that have been within the named multi-entry/multi-exit detector within the last simulation step [m/s] of lane 4. 
    The actions available in the action space that can control the intersection are the following:
    Actions set the phase of the traffic light to the given:
    - 0: Green light North-South. 
    - 1: Green light East-West. 
    Please choose from these actions and give me your choice in JSON format.
